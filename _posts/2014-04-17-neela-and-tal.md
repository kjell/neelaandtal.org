title: How Neela and Tal begin
---

## Neela's version

Neela & Tal first met in early Spring 2012 at the Birthday party of a
dear friend of Neela's. Tal had been working in the Dietzel's garden for
the day, and joined the Dietzel's in attending the party. They exchanged
mildly warm hellos, Neela noted Tal's eccentric dance style, and Tal was
informed of the single ladies at the party—including Neela. But no
lightning bolts of love just yet!

Then in late fall—Neela and Tal, both still single, had both signed up
on OK Cupid (an online dating site) in the hopes of finding love. And
walaaaa! There Neela came acrosss a profile of one SnapPeas---with a bio
that included interest in Rudolf Steiner and  Biodynamic Farming. Neela
noticed that indeed this was the man from the party! Tal instantly fell
madly in love with the beautiful woman in the pictures of her bio on OK
Cupid. After a few months of email exchanges, their first date was a
walk around Lake Harriet and the Bird Sanctuary. On their second date
Tal won Neela's heart with a warm dish of brown rice, green beans,
biodynamic ground beef, home made kimchi, and the first site of Tal
without his glasses. 

In spring of 2013 Tal moved in with Neela and her son Makai, and easily
yet gently the three have become a family. One year later, a few days
before Neela's second trip and Makai's first trip to visit Tal's family
in CA, Tal proposed to Neela with an eloquent and silly poem---that
included:

...Shall I compare thee to the carrot family?
With it's fine leaves
single taproot
and earthy fragrance....

yet, let's tarry a bit longer....
like the night shade you do not advertise the poisonous parts
yet can I, the sun, love even that?
You have enough light to love your darkness
and so do I 

…..so what sayest you?
Will you or no?
We have already been watered
we've already sprouted
Let's build our soil fertility together
let's bear fruit
make deep roots
and cleanse our souls and our earth together
Neela, will you marry me?

Neela was surprised, touched, tickled, and totally excited-and of
course, wholeheartedly said yes!

## Tal's version

Sometime in early March 2012

Marianne stares at Tal with knowing eyes. 
“Do you know Elena? She's having a birthday party, and you should come”
“But I'm still in my work clothes.”
“Why don't you borrow one of Dennis' dress shirts.”
Dennis brings Tal a shirt. 
“Ugh! OK. I guess I'll go.”

At the party
“So let me show you who all the single ladies are...” Marianne is on a
mission. 

Still later, Marianne and Neela are sitting on the couch. Tal comes
over. 
“Tal, this is Neela,” Marianne says.
“Hi.” Tal says
“Hi.” Neela says. 
And that was it. Both shy, Marianne continues to talk to Neela and Tal
remains silent. 

That Fall
On a whim, Tal re-upped his OKCupid account, and began getting his feet
wet in the online dating scene. 

A month later, Tal gets a message from Blue Mountain. “Whoa! Who is
that?!” After one look at the photos, he knew she was the one. Neela
wrote that they had met at a party in the Spring. 
“Huh?” Tal replied. 
“You know, Elena's party. I met you on the couch.”
“Oh, yeah, I sort of remember now.”

After several dates and few poems, Tal moved in.

In Winter
“Whoa, that jump looks really dangerous,” Tal says. “Let's stay to the
right.”
Makai leads Tal closer to the left with each run down the slope. 
“We seem to be getting closer, let's stay to the right.”
“We won't hit it,” Makai responds.
The next time down the sled starts straight then suddenly veers left.
Tal braces himself as the sled goes over the jump, both fly into the
air, and land. Makai laughs. Tal yells as his butt lands on the ice. 
“I didn't want to do that! I'm done. We're going home!”

And the rest can be left to the imagination...
