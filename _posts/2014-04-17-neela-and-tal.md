title: How Neela and Tal began
---


Neela & Tal first met in early Spring 2012 at the Birthday party of a dear friend of Neela's. At the party the two exchanged mildly warm hellos—but there were no lightning bolts of love just yet!

Then in fall, Neela and Tal had both signed up on OK Cupid (an online dating site) in the hopes of finding love. There Neela came acrosss a profile of one SnapPeas---with a bio that included interest in Rudolf Steiner and Biodynamic Farming. Neela noticed that indeed this was the man from the party, and sent him a message. Though he vaguely remembered her, at first glance of Neela's OK Cupid photos Tal knew that she was the one! After a few months of email exchanges, their first date was a walk around Lake Harriet and the Bird Sanctuary. On their second date Tal won Neela's heart with a warm dish of brown rice, green beans, biodynamic ground beef, home made kimchi, and the first sight of Tal without his glasses.

In spring of 2013 after many dates, plenty of playtime with Makai (Neela's 8 year old son), and a few poems-- Tal moved in with Neela and Makai. And easily yet gently the three have become a family.

One year later, a few days before Neela's second trip and Makai's first trip to visit Tal's family in California, Tal proposed with an eloquent and silly poem---that included:

> ...Shall I compare thee to the carrot family?  
With it's fine leaves  
single taproot  
and earthy fragrance....  

> yet, let's tarry a bit....  
like the night shade who hides its flowers from the sun  
you do not advertise the poisonous parts  
yet can I, the sun, love even that?  
You have enough light to love your darkness  
and so do I  

> ...let's lighten the mood again  
tarry some more  
shall I compare thee to the cabbage family? With it's familiar smell  
and its flexible, adaptable nature  
It offers its whole self to be eaten  
as you offer yourself in service to your family...  
We are now companions  
Both of us together greater than  
each apart  
like carrots and peas  
or corn, beans, and squash since we are three  

> ...so what sayest you?  
Will you or no?  
We have already been watered  
we've already sprouted  
Let's build our soil fertility together  
let's bear fruit  
make deep roots  
and cleanse our souls and our earth  

> Neela, will you marry me?

Neela was surprised, touched, tickled, and totally excited—and of course, wholeheartedly said yes!
