Dear Guests! We are registered at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/DCL1KBD4XCIQ)
or, as an alternative, we'd so gratefully accept any cash contributions towards our honeymoon to Esalen Institute in Big Sur!    

### Generosity, and other concepts

We'd like to state the obvious: there is no right or wrong way to conduct a wedding. So when you come, we invite you to relax and let go of any already formed concepts of “wedding.”

Next, we would like to break another myth. There is no right or wrong way to give a wedding gift. we invite you to give a gift that feels expansive, free, and good to you. Tal is inspired by the Buddhist tradition exemplified by Common Ground Meditation Center, of generosity. The center has no fees for its classes, yet they rely on donations for all operating expenses. Classes and programs are offered generously. Another piece is that when one brings mindfulness and awareness to giving and receiving, this frees the heart from clinging. What a relief! Imagine giving and receiving freely. And in bringing awareness to it, you benefit also! In thinking about a wedding gift, we recognise each person has different circumstances and that your presence and good wishes are already a gift. Whatever you decide to offer, may it be done mindfully, freely, and joyfully. 

Thank you!
